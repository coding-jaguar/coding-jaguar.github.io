        <!--Course Overview-->
        <h2 class="heading"> Course Overview</h2>
        <p class="aim"> Before the three decades, design based on digital circuits are widely used because of more
            flexibility and reliability. There are no doughs that any analog functions are implemented in the digital
            domain, for example, digital radio. However, the physical world is inherently analog. indicating that there
            will always need for analog circuits to condition the physical signals such as associated with transducers
            and data conversion. Also, new applications like wireless communication continue to emerge where speed and
            power make more used in the analog front end design. Many applications today mixed mode ICs where analog
            circuit interface with the physical world and digital circuit for processing and control. However, the
            analog circuit contains a small area on chip (about 20%), it is a more challenging part of the design,
            affect the overall performance of the system.

            This course introduces design and analysis of analog Circuits using an operational amplifier. The different
            challenges and issues are identified in designing of analog circuit as compared with digital design. The
            course includes basic op-amp configurations, linear and non-linear applications of the op-amp and active
            filter synthesis, including timer ICs, Phase Locked Loop ICs, Voltage regulators and power amplifiers.</p>
