            <dt><strong> Offset Voltage Measurement</strong></dt>
            <dd>It is defined as the differential voltage required between the inputs of an operational amplifier to
                make the output zero. Input offset voltage is found to be 10.34uV.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Input Bias Current and Input Offset Current Measurement</strong></dt>
            <dd>It is the average of current that flows into the inverting and non-inverting input terminal of op- amp.
                Input offset current is the difference between the current flowing into the inverting and non-inverting
                terminal. Ib = 79.7nA and Io = 0.113nA.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Input Resistance</strong></dt>
            <dd>By applying DC supply of 1V at the non-inverting terminal and the varying resistance R1 until the output
                voltage becomes half. R1 is found to be 6.25MΩ.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Output Resistance</strong></dt>
            <dd>By applying DC supply of 200mV at the non-inverting input and reducing the load resistance R1 from a
                higher value we get value of Rl for which Vo becomes half is the Output resistance. Zout
                = 43Ω.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>CMRR</strong></dt>
            <dd>Ability of differential amplifier to reject the common mode signal is called common mode rejection
                ratio. For common mode, apply the same input of 0.5V to both the terminals and observe the output
                voltage. For differential mode, apply different input to both the terminals and observe the output. CMRR
                (dB) = 20*log (Ad/Acm) = 104.10dB.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Open Loop Gain</strong> </dt>
            <dd>Open loop gain is the overall voltage gain. Apply AC signal of 1V, 1kHz to inverting and ground the
                non-inverting terminal. Take the ratio Vout/Vin to obtain Av = 95.5.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Gain Bandwidth Product</strong> </dt>
            <dd>Construct a circuit with gain 1 and vary the input frequency, at a particular frequency, output voltage
                will be equal to 0.707Vmax. Then construct a circuit with gain = 10 and perform the same procedure. Gain
                Bandwidth product is obtained to be 160k.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Slew Rate</strong> </dt>
            <dd>Slew rate is the measure of how fast the output can follow the input signal. Another formula of Slew
                Rate = 2Π * fm * Vm. 1V input sine wave is applied at the non-inverting terminal. It is calculated by
                voltage follower circuit. The frequency at which the output starts getting distorted is fm. Slew rate =
                0.691 V/us.</dd><br>
